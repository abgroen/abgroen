My name is Anders Grøn, I'm standing at 6'4", and I grew up in a suburban area near Fredericia, a midsize city in southern Jutland, Denmark. You have arrived at my personal web page. Read along for personal as well as professional insights into my world. Feel free to reach out. 

I have been offered a PhD scholarship at Aarhus University (beginning Sept. 2020), which is the same place I studied Political Science from 2014 to 2019. My PhD will focus on public leadership and I will be affiliated with the  <a href = "https://ps.au.dk/en/crown-prince-frederik-center-for-public-leadership/" rel ="follow"><strong>Crown Prince Frederik Center for Public Leadership</strong></a>. My research interests in general include collaborative leadership, organizational coordination and data science.
