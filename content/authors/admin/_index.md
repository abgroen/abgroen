My name is Anders. Welcome to my personal webstie and PhD universe where I share all sorts of insights and thoughts in medias res. I cover themes of both personal and academic character, compile blog posts and podcasts related to e.g. data science and life as a PhD student, and share my personal and professional data-driven projects and publications.

I've been offered a PhD scholarship beginning Sept. 2020 at Aarhus University which is the same place I got my BSc and MSc degrees in Political Science. My PhD project will focus on leadership and collaboration in the public sector and I'll be affiliated with the <a href = "https://ps.au.dk/en/crown-prince-frederik-center-for-public-leadership/" rel ="follow"><strong>Crown Prince Frederik Center for Public Leadership</strong></a>. My main supervisor will be <a href = "https://pure.au.dk/portal/da/persons/christian-boetcher-jacobsen(fd9dea84-2af2-4d41-89ac-117e13f5324c).html" rel ="follow"><strong>Christian Bøtcher Jacobsen</strong></a> who serves as the center's vice director.

My research interests include public leadership and performance, social innovation, organizational coordination, and data scientific methods. I'm enthusiastic about using methods from modern statistics and data visualization to extract meaningful patterns from intertwined, unstructured datasets. As such, it's my passion to tell stories through complex data as well as illuminate omnipresent, ever-changing challenges within the public, civic, and social realms of society.

I live in Copenhagen at the moment but move to Aarhus come summer 2020. Feel free to take a look at my <a href = "https://www.abgroen.com/files/cv.pdf" rel ="follow"><strong>CV</strong></a> or <a href = "https://www.abgroen.com/#contact" rel ="follow"><strong>reach out</strong></a> if anything sparks your interest.
