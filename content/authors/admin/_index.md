My name is Anders. Welcome to my personal website. 

I am a PhD fellow at Aarhus University, Denmark. My PhD project focuses on leadership and collaboration in the public sector and I am affiliated with the <a href = "https://ps.au.dk/en/crown-prince-frederik-center-for-public-leadership/" rel ="follow"><strong>Crown Prince Frederik Center for Public Leadership</strong></a>. My main supervisor is <a href = "https://pure.au.dk/portal/da/persons/christian-boetcher-jacobsen(fd9dea84-2af2-4d41-89ac-117e13f5324c).html" rel ="follow"><strong>Christian Bøtcher Jacobsen</strong></a> who serves as the center's vice director. My research interests include public leadership and performance, social innovation, organizational coordination, and data scientific methods. It's a passion of mine to tell stories through complex data and hopefully illuminate omnipresent, ever-changing challenges within the public, civic, and social realms of society.

At this website you'll find my own little PhD universe where I share all sorts of insights and thoughts in medias res - that is content of both personal and academic character, blog-posts and podcasts related to e.g. data science and life as a PhD student, and personal and professional projects and publications.

Feel free to take a look at my <a href = "https://www.abgroen.com/files/cv.pdf" rel ="follow"><strong>CV</strong></a> or <a href = "https://www.abgroen.com/#contact" rel ="follow"><strong>reach out</strong></a> if anything sparks your interest.
