I grew up in a suburban area near Fredericia, a midsize city in southern Jutland, Denmark. I have been offered a PhD scholarship at Aarhus University, that is the same place I studied Political Science from 2014 to 2019.

My PhD will focus on public leadership and I will be affiliated with the  <a href = "https://ps.au.dk/en/crown-prince-frederik-center-for-public-leadership/" rel ="follow"><strong>Crown Prince Frederik Center for Public Leadership</strong></a>. My research interests include collaborative leadership, organizational coordination and data science.
