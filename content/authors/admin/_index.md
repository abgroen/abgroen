My name is Anders Grøn, I'm standing tall at 6'4", and I grew up in a suburban area near Fredericia, a midsize city in southern Denmark. You have arrived at my personal web page where I share personal and professional insights into my world as it unfolds. These insights cover thoughts on my academic background, blog posts related to data science and life as a PhD student, professional and personal data-driven projects, and academic publications. Feel free to <a href = "https://www.abgroen.com/#contact" rel ="follow"><strong>reach out</strong></a> if anything sparks your interest.

I have been offered a PhD scholarship beginning Sept. 2020 at Aarhus University which is the same place I achieved my BSc and Msc degrees in Political Science between 2014 and 2019. My PhD project will focus on collaborative public leadership and I will be affiliated with the <a href = "https://ps.au.dk/en/crown-prince-frederik-center-for-public-leadership/" rel ="follow"><strong>Crown Prince Frederik Center for Public Leadership</strong></a>. My main supervisor will be <a href = "https://pure.au.dk/portal/da/persons/christian-boetcher-jacobsen(fd9dea84-2af2-4d41-89ac-117e13f5324c).html" rel ="follow"><strong>Christian Bøtcher Jacobsen</strong></a>.

My research interests in general include collaborative leadership, organizational coordination and data science. As such, I love dealing with complex data and it is my passion to tell stories using data and solve problems within the public and social realm. I am enthusiastic about leveraging methods of modern statistics and data visualisation to extract patterns from intertwined, unstructured datasets.
