My name is Anders Grøn. I'm an avid runner, decent cook, and fast-balding young professional. You have arrived at my personal web page where I share insights into my life as it unfolds. These insights cover thoughts on my personal and academic background, blog posts and podcasts related to e.g. data science and life as a PhD student, cool professional and personal data-driven projects, and my academic publications (might be a while...).

I have been offered a PhD scholarship beginning Sept. 2020 at Aarhus University which is the same place I achieved my BSc and MSc degrees in Political Science between 2014 and 2019. My PhD project will focus on collaborative public leadership and I will be affiliated with the <a href = "https://ps.au.dk/en/crown-prince-frederik-center-for-public-leadership/" rel ="follow"><strong>Crown Prince Frederik Center for Public Leadership</strong></a>. My main supervisor will be <a href = "https://pure.au.dk/portal/da/persons/christian-boetcher-jacobsen(fd9dea84-2af2-4d41-89ac-117e13f5324c).html" rel ="follow"><strong>Christian Bøtcher Jacobsen</strong></a> who serves as the center's vice director.

My research interests include public leadership and performance, social innovation, organizational coordination, and data scientific methods. I am enthusiastic about using methods from modern statistics and data visualisation to extract meaningful patterns from intertwined, unstructured datasets. As such, I love dealing with complex data and it is my passion to use data to tell stories as well as illuminate omnipresent and ever-changing problems within the public and social realms of our society.

I live in Copenhagen at the moment but I move to Aarhus come summer 2020. Feel free to <a href = "https://www.abgroen.com/#contact" rel ="follow"><strong>reach out</strong></a> if anything sparks your interest.
