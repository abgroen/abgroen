Welcome! 

And thank you for letting yourself in. You might rightly wonder what you have signed up for by stopping by here - hopefully this post clarifies my intentions even though, disclaimer, they might change extensively in the coming months.

Well then, what is this place? Think of it as my personal PhD universe - a place for me to indulge and write about the parts of life I find most fulfilling: being a PhD student, understanding the sociology and psychology of leadership, motivation, and cooperation, discussing data scientific methods, dissecting the role of science in modern society, engaging in philosophical conversations, and becoming financially independent - just to name a few. Granted: the latter is more hobby-minded than PhD-related but there is room for thematic excursions, I’d said. And it is my universe after all.

Going forward, the different themes will be discussed under individual headings and branches (look out for funny titles) so that you can join in on the ones you find most interesting. I’ll soon present the themes in separate posts as well as particular content ideas, e.g. tips and tricks for applying for a PhD fellowship and discussions of how data science and social good can be combined to a larger degree, how the flexibility of the welfare state can be strengthened, and why passive index fund investing as well as aspiring to become a modern Reinasance person are desirable. In due time I’ll dedicate a post or two towards presenting myself as well - for now you can check out my website to get an idea of who I am - and likewise my comings and goings as a grad student will be highlighted in small “day in the life”-snippets.

Besides developing this blog-ish dimension, I’m constantly thinking of how to expand my universe (pun intended). I’ve got a few ideas: Within the next couple of months I expect to have a newsletter and the usual SoMe up and running, a structure for a podcast sketched out, and the webpage honed. 

I hope you’ll tune in on the other channels as well - stay tuned. 

‘til next time, all the best
Anders
